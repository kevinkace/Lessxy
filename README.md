Some sexy LESS mixins.

## What is it?

A collection of [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) mixins that _may_ save you DOZENS of character typing.

So instead of typing this:

    div {
        border-top:    solid 1px #000;
        border-bottom: solid 1px #000;
    }

You only type this (which will compile to the above):

    div {
        .border-x(solid 1px #000);
    }

Not much here right now, but just you wait...
